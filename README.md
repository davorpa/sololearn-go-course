## Welcome to our Go course!

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.

The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name, [golang.org](https://golang.org), but its proper name is Go.
